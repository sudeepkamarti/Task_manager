<h3>S.no.Temples</h3>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virupaksha_Temple,_Hampi">Virupaksha Temple</a></li><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virupaksha_Temple,_Hampi"><img class="img" src="Virupaksha.jpg"> </a><p class="s">The temple's history is uninterrupted from about the 7th century. The Virupaksha-Pampa sanctuary existed well before the Vijayanagara capital was located here. 
Inscriptions referring to Shiva date back to the 9th and 10th centuries.
 What started as a small shrine grew into a large complex under the Vijayanagara rulers. 
Evidence indicates there were additions made to the temple in the late Chalukyan and Hoysala periods, though most of the temple buildings are attributed to the Vijayanagara period. 
The huge temple building was built by Lakkana Dandesha, a chieftain under the ruler Deva Raya II of the Vijayanagara Empire.Ceiling Paintings in the Virupaksha date to fourteenth and sixteenth century. The religious sect of Virupaksha-Pampa did not end with the destruction of the city in 1565.
 Worship there has persisted throughout the years. 
 At the beginning of the 19th century there were major renovations and additions, which included restoring some of the broken towers of the north and east gopura.
 At present, the main temple consists of a sanctum, three ante chambers, a pillared hall and an open pillared hall. 
It is decorated with delicately carved pillars. A pillared cloister, entrance gateways, courtyards, smaller shrines and other structures surround the temple.

The nine-tiered eastern gateway, which is the largest at 50 meters, is well-proportioned and incorporates some earlier structures. It has a brick superstructure and a stone base. 
It gives access to the outer court containing many sub-shrines.

The smaller eastern gateway leads to the inner court with its numerous smaller shrines.

Another gopuram towards north known as the Kanakagiri gopura, leads to a small enclosure with subsidiary shrines and eventually to the river Tungabhadra.

A narrow channel of the Tungabhadra River flows along the temple's terrace and then descends to the temple-kitchen and out through the outer court.[citation needed]
One of the most striking features of this temple is the usage of mathematical concepts to build and decorate it. The temple has repeated patterns that demonstrate the concept of Fractals.
 The main shape of the temple is triangular. 
 As you look up the temple top, the patterns divide and repeat themselves, just like you would see in a snowflake or some other natural wonders.
Krishnadevaraya, one of the famous kings of the Vijayanagara Empire was a major patron of this temple.
 The most ornate of all structures in the temple, the central pillared hall is believed to be his addition to this temple. 
 So is the gateway tower giving access to the inner courtyard of the temple. Inscriptions on a stone plaque installed next to the pillared hall explain his contribution to the temple.
 It is recorded that Krishna Devaraya commissioned this hall in 1510 AD to mark his accession. 
 He also built the eastern gopuram. These additions meant that the central shrine came to occupy a relatively small part of the complex.
 The halls in the temple were used for a variety of purposes. Some were spaces in which the images of gods were placed to witness special programmes of music, dance, drama, etc. 
Others were used to celebrate the marriages of deities.

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampi">Vitthala Temple</a></li><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampi"><img class="img" src="vitthalatemple.jpg"></a>
<p class="s">The Vittala Temple or Vitthala Temple in Hampi is an ancient monument that is well-known for its exceptional architecture and unmatched craftsmanship. 
It is considered to be one of the largest and the most famous structure in Hampi. The temple is located in the north eastern part of Hampi, near the banks of the Tungabhadra River.

The iconic temple has amazing stone structures such as the incomparable stone chariot and the fascinating musical pillars. 
This predominant monument of Hampi is a major attraction of the ruined town and is a must-see for visitors and tourists.
The renowned Vittala Temple dates back to the 15th century. It was built during the reign of King Devaraya II (1422 ‚Äì 1446 A.D.), one of the rulers of the Vijayanagara Empire. 
Several portions of the temple were expanded and enhanced during the reign of Krishnadevaraya (1509 ‚Äì 1529 A.D.), the most famous ruler of the Vijayanagara dynasty.
 He played a significant role in giving the monument its present look.
 The Vittala Temple is also known as Shri Vijaya Vitthala Temple. It is dedicated to Lord Vitthala, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu.
 An idol of Vitthala-Vishnu was enshrined in the temple. Legend has it that the temple was built as an abode for Lord Vishnu in his Vitthala form.
 However, the Lord had found the temple to be too grand for his use and had returned to live in his own humble home.
 The Vittala Temple is presumed to be the grandest of all temples and monuments in Hampi. 
The temple exemplifies the immense creativity and architectural excellence possessed by the sculptors and artisans of the Vijayanagara era.

The Vittala temple is built in the Dravidian style of architecture. It has traits and features that are characteristic of typical south Indian temple architecture.
 It‚Äôs elaborate and artistic carvings and magnificent architecture is unmatched by any other structure found in Hampi.

It is believed that the main shrine of the temple originally had one enclosed Mantapa. An open Mantapa was added to it in the year 1554 A.D.

The temple complex is a sprawling area that is surrounded by high compound walls and three towering gateways. The temple complex has many halls, shrines and pavilions located inside it. 
Each of these structures is made of stone and each structure is a beauty in itself.</p>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gommateshwara_statue">Gommateshwara Temple</a></li><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gommateshwara_statue"><img class="img" src="Gommateshwara.jpg"></a></li><p class="s">The Gommateshwara statue is a 57-foot (17 m) high monolithic statue on Vindhyagiri Hill in the town of Shravanbelagola in the Indian state of Karnataka.
 Carved of a single block of granite, it is one of the tallest monolithic statues in the ancient world.

The Gommateshwara statue is dedicated to the Jain figure Bahubali and symbolises the Jain precepts of peace, non-violence, sacrifice of worldly affairs, and simple living. 
It was built around 983 CE during the Western Ganga dynasty and is one of the largest free-standing statues in the world.It was regarded the tallest Jain statue until 2016.
 The construction of the statue was commissioned by the Ganga dynasty minister and commander Chavundaraya. Neighbouring areas have Jain temples known as basadis and several images of the Tirthankaras.
 Vindyagiri Hill is one of the two hills in Shravanabelagola. The other is Chandragiri, which is also a seat of several ancient Jain centres, much older than Gommateshwara statue.
 Chandragiri is dedicated to the Jain figure Bharat, the brother of Bahubali and the son of the first Tirthankara Rishabhnath.
A Jain event known as Mahamastakabhisheka attracts devotees from all over the world. The Mahamastakabhisheka festival is held once every 12 years, when the Gommateshwara statue is ritually bathed in milk, saffron, ghee, sugarcane juice (ishukrasa), etc. 
German Indologist Heinrich Zimmer attributed this anointment as the reason for the statue's freshness.
The next abhishekam (ritual bathing) will be in 2030.
In 2007, the statue was voted the first of Seven Wonders of India in a Times of India poll; 49% of the total votes went in favour of it.
The Archaeological Survey of India has listed the Gommateshwara statue in a group of monuments in Shravanabelagola known as the Adarsh Smarak Monument.
The statue depicts the prolonged meditation of Bahubali. The motionless contemplation in kayotsarga (standing still) posture led to the growth of climbing vines around his legs.
 The nagna (nude) image of Gommateshwara has curly hair ringlets and large ears. The eyes are half open, sight rested on nose showcasing his detachment to look on the world.
 His facial features are perfectly chiseled with a faint touch of a smile at the corner of the lips that embodies a calm inner peace and vitality.
 His shoulders are broad, the arms stretch straight down and the figure has no support from the thigh upwards.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_temple,_Aihole">Durga Temple</a></li><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_temple,_Aihole"><img class="img" src="Durga.jpg"></a><p class="s">Nartiang Durga Temple is a 600-year-old temple located in the West Jaintia Hills district of Meghalaya in northeastern India.
 It is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas and is one of the holiest sites for devotees of the Shaktism sect of Hinduism.
 The Hindus in the Jaintia Hills of Meghalaya believes that this temple is the permanent abode of Goddess Durga.

    The temple draws a large number of pilgrims from all over the country on occasion of Durga Puja.
    The Shakti of Nartiang Devi shrine is worshipped as Jayanti and the Bhairava as Kamadishwar.
    The Nartiang Devi Temple is believed to be a Shakti Peetha, one of the most revered shrines of Shaktism as 
    Shakti Peethas are Holy abodes of Parashakti. The Shakti Peethas have originated from the mythology of Daksha yagna and Sati's self immolation 
    Shiva carried the corpse of Sati Devi and 51 body parts of the corpse fell in the path He had wandered. 

    Devi's left thigh is believed to have fallen at Nartiang in the Jaintia Hills. Hence the Goddess is known as Jainteshwari. 
    The Jaintia king Jaso Manik (1606‚Äì1641) had married Lakshmi Narayana, the daughter of the Hindu Koch king Nara Narayana.
    It is believed that it was Lakshmi Narayana who had influenced the Jaintia Royalty to embrace Hinduism. 
    King Dhan Manik had made Nartiang the summer capital of the Jaintia Kingdom about 600 years ago. 
    One night, the goddess appeared to him in a dream and informed him of the significance of the place and asked him to build a temple in Her honour.

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_temple,_Aihole">Murudeshwar Temple.</li><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_temple,_Aihole"><img class="img" src="Mahadev.jpg"><p class="s"></a>The origin of the name "Murdeshwar" dates to the time of Ramayana. The Hindu gods attained immortality and invincibility by worshiping a divine Linga called the Atma-Linga. 
The Lanka King Ravana wanted to attain immortality by obtaining the Atma-Linga (Soul of Shiva). Since the Atma-Linga belonged to Shiva, Ravana worshipped Shiva with devotion. 
Pleased by his prayers, Shiva appeared before him and asked him what he wanted. Ravana asked for the Atma-Linga. 
Shiva agreed to give him the boon on the condition that it should never be placed on the ground before he reaches Lanka. If the Atma-Linga was ever placed on the ground, it would be impossible to move it. 
Having obtained his boon, Ravana started back on his journey to Lanka.

Lord Vishnu, who learned of this incident, realised that with the Atma-Linga, Ravana may obtain immortality and wreak havoc on earth. 
He approached Ganesha and requested him to prevent the Atma-Linga from reaching Lanka.
 Ganesha knew that Ravana was a very devoted person who performed prayer rituals every evening without fail. 
 He decided to make use of this fact and came up with a plan to confiscate the Atma-Linga from Ravana.

As Ravana was nearing Gokarna, Vishnu blotted out the sun to give the appearance of dusk. 
Ravana now had to perform his evening rituals but was worried because with the Atma-Linga in his hands, he would not be able to do his rituals. At this time, Ganesha in the disguise of a Brahmin boy accosted him.
 Ravana requested him to hold the Atma-Linga until he performed his rituals, and asked him not to place it on the ground.
 Ganesha struck a deal with him saying that he would call Ravana thrice, and if Ravana did not return within that time, he would place the Atma-Linga on the ground.

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoysaleswara_Temple">Hoysaleshwara Temple</a></li><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoysaleswara_Temple"><img class="img" src="ishwara.jpg"><p class="s"></a>The Hoysalesvara temple was one of the first to be properly surveyed in Karnataka between 1801 and 1806. After the invention of photography, it was one of the earliest to be photographed in British India. These show neglect and scattered ruins.
The Hoysala period of South Indian history began about 1000 CE and continued through 1346 CE.
 In this period, they built around 1,500 temples in 958 centres.Halebidu was originally called Dorasamudra in its inscriptions, possibly derived from Dvarasamudra (Sanskrit words "Dvara" (gateway, door) and Samudra (ocean, sea, large water body)).
 The capital used to be Belur, Karnataka, but Dorasamudra became the established capital under king Vishnuvardhana and served as the capital of the Hoyasala Empire for nearly 300 years.

Unlike other Hoysala temples that have survived into the modern age, and despite numerous inscriptions in the temple premises, the Hoysaleswara Temple lacks a dedication inscription.
 It is likely lost, along with the many other features of the original temple. An inscription found about five kilometers from the temple site, near the Kallesvara temple ruins in Ghattadahalli, states that Ketamalla ‚Äì officer in the employ of king Vishnuvardhana constructed this temple.
 It also notes that the king made grant of lands to support the construction, the operation and the maintenance of the Shiva temple in Saka 1043, or 1121 CE.It was not the only temple built in that era.
 The inscriptions suggest that the capital consisted of numerous other temples, both of Hinduism and Jainism traditions, along with stepwells, ponds and mantapas (mandapas, public halls) in the vicinity of the large Dorasamudhra lake.
 It is the largest temple built by the Hoysalas that is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva in South India.

The Hoysala Empire and its capital Dorasamudra was invaded, plundered and destroyed in early 14th century by the Delhi Sultanate armies of Alauddin Khilji, with Belur and Halebidu becoming the target of plunder and destruction in 1326 CE by another Delhi Sultanate army of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq.
The territory was taken over by the Vijayanagara Empire. The Hoysala kingdom, states James C. 
Harle, came to an end in mid 14th century, when King Ballala III was killed in a war with the Muslim army of Madurai Sultanate.
Dorasamudra and its temples became ruins, the capital abandoned and the site became known as "Halebidu" (literally, "old camp or capital").About 300 of the original Hoysala Empire temples survive in different states of damage, scattered around Karnataka. 
Of these, states Hardy, about 70 had been studied to varying degrees of detail by 1995.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennakeshava_Temple,_Belur"><img class="img"  src="kesawara.jpg"><p class="s"></a>
The Somanathapura town was founded in the 13th century by a general named Somanatha (Someya Dandanayaka in some inscriptions). He was working for the Hoysala King Narasimha III.
[8] Somanatha created an Agrahara, that is granted land to Brahmins and dedicated resources to build and maintain temples therein.
The town (pura) became known after the name of the patron, Somanatha-pura.
 The location is also referred by alternate spellings, such as Somnathpur.

In the middle of the new settlement, Somanatha built the Kesava temple and consecrated it in 1258 CE.[note 1]
 This was a Vaishnavism tradition temple. 
 In addition to this temple, Somanatha consecrated a Shaivism tradition related Panchalinga temple (literally, "five linga temple") in the east-northeast corner of the land grant. 
 He also built a fort wall around the land, but these are now in ruins.
 According to the inscriptions and textual evidence, 
 Somanatha additionally built the Purahara, Narasimhesvara, Murahara, Lakshminarasimha and Yoganarayana temples in Hoysala style in the region, but all these temples except the Lakshminarasimha have disappeared, after wars between the Hindu kingdoms and Muslim Sultanates ravaged the region. 
 The Lakshminarasimha temple is also in ruins. From the other disappeared temples, the sanctum image of Yoganarayana temple is only known surviving artwork, but it too is in a damaged form.

The Kesava temple too was badly damaged, according to 15th-century inscriptions.
 It was repaired in the 16th century with financial support and grants by the emperors of the Vijayanagara Empire.
 The repairs are evidenced by the different color of stones and quality of work in the veranda and parts of the northern tower and platform of the main temple.
 The repaired temple was damaged in the 19th century, then repaired again in the early 20th century by the colonial era Mysore government.

A part of the Kannada inscription stone at Keshava temple entrance.
The Kesava temple is one of some 1,500 Hindu and Jain temples built by the Hoysala Empire kings in different parts of their kingdom.
 The other well studied Hoysala temples include those at Belur and Halebidu.

The temple was destroyed during Muslim attacks in the Hoysala kingdoms. 
The first attack was by Malik Kafur, Alauddin Khilji's general in 1311 and in 1326 Muhammad Bin Tughlaq destroyed the remaining structures.
 Some parts of the temples were restored by Vijayanagara Kings and later by Wodeyars of Mysuru.

Gadag city is the administrative headquarters of Gadag district in the state of Karnataka, India. The primary deity in temple is the Hindu god Narayana (also known as Vishnu). 
The Veeranarayana temple is a protected monument under the Karnataka state division of the Archaeological Survey of India.

the rule of King Achyuta Deva Raya confirms a gift (Anandanidhi) given by the king to the temple.[citation needed]
History has it that Vishnuvardhana (originally known as Bitti Deva) was influenced by Ramanujacharya (or simply Ramanuja) when the saint cured a Hoysala princess of illness.
 Bitti Deva changed his name to "Vishnuvardhana", gave up his original faith Jainism, and became a Srivaishnava (a follower of a stream of the Vaishnava sect of Hinduism) and a devotee of Ramanujacharya.
 The king built five temples for the god Vishnu: the Veeranarayana temple at Gadag, the Nambinarayana temple at Tondanur, the Chennakesava Temple at Belur, the Kirtinarayana temple at Talakad and the Cheluvanarayana temple at Melkote.
 34 medieval inscriptions have been discovered in Gadag, mostly within the premises of the two important temples in the town: the "Veeranarayana" and the "Trikuteshwara" temples.
 From these inscriptions there is ample evidence Gadag was a notable place of learning (maha-agrahara) administered by 72 mahajanas (maha meaning "important" and jana meaning "persons") during ancient times.[citation needed]

During the Vijayanagar empire era, according to the scholar D. Sheshagiri Rao, the notable Kannada poet Kumara Vyasa who called Gadag his home and the god Narayana (of Gadag) his favorite deity, 
wrote his Kannada version of the Hindu epic Mahabharata making adulatory references invariably to the deity of this temple at the end of each canto (sandhi) .
Legend has it that it was in this temple, at a particular pillar in the hall, that Kumara Vyasa accomplished the epic having received divine inspiration from his deity.
An inscription of c.1539 inscribed during the rule of King Achyuta Deva Raya confirms a gift (Anandanidhi) given by the king to the temple.[citation needed

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanchi">Sanchi Stupa</a></li><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanchi"><img src="Sanchi.jpg"></a>
<p class="s"> Sanchi is a Buddhist complex, famous for its Great Stupa, on a hilltop at Sanchi Town in Raisen District of the State of Madhya Pradesh, India. 
It is located, about 23 kilometers from Raisen town, district headquarter and 46 kilometres (29 mi) north-east of Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh.

The Great Stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India, and an important monument of Indian Architecture.[1] It was originally commissioned by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BCE.
 Its nucleus was a simple hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of the Buddha. It was crowned by the chatra, a parasol-like structure symbolising high rank, which was intended to honour and shelter the relics.
 The original construction work of this stupa was overseen by Ashoka, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby Vidisha. Sanchi was also her birthplace as well as the venue of her and Ashoka's wedding.
 In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately carved toranas (ornamental gateways) and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added. The Sanchi Stupa built during the Mauryan period was made of bricks. The composite flourished until the 11th century.

Sanchi is the center of a region with a number of stupas, all within a few miles of Sanchi, including Satdhara (9 km to the W of Sanchi, 40 stupas, the Relics of Sariputra and Mahamoggallana, 
now enshrined in the new Vihara, were unearthed there), Bhojpur (also called Morel Khurd, a fortified hilltop with 60 stupas) and Andher (respectively 11 km and 17 km SE of Sanchi), as well as Sonari (10 km SW of Sanchi).
 Further south, about 100 km away, is Saru Maru. Bharhut is 300 km to the northeast.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khajuraho_Group_of_Monuments"><img src="Khajuraho.jpg"></a><p class="s">
The Khajuraho Group of Monuments are a group of Hindu and Jain temples in Chhatarpur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. They are about 175 kilometres (109 mi) southeast of Jhansi, 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Khajwa, 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) from Rajnagar, and 49 kilometres (30 mi)
from district headquarter Chhatarpur. The temples are famous for their Nagara-style architectural symbolism and a few erotic sculptures.[1]

Most Khajuraho temples were built between 885 CE and 1000 CE by the Chandela dynasty.
Historical records note that the Khajuraho temple site had 85 temples by the 12th century, spread over 20 square kilometres (7.7 sq mi). Of these, only about 25 temples have survived, spread over six square kilometres (2.3 sq mi).
 Of the surviving temples, the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple is decorated with a profusion of sculptures with intricate details, symbolism, and expressiveness of ancient Indian art.
 The temple complex was forgotten and overgrown by the jungle until 1838 when Captain T.S. Burt, a British engineer, visited the complex and reported his findings in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.

When these monuments were built, the boys in the place lived in hermitages, by being brahmacharyas (bachelors) until they attained manhood and these sculptures helped them to learn about the worldly role of 'householder'.
 The Khajuraho group of temples were built together but were dedicated to two religions, Hinduism and Jainism, suggesting a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views among Hindus and Jains in the region.
Because of their outstanding architecture, diversity of temple forms, and testimony to the Chandela civilization, the monuments at Khajuraho were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1986.</p></li><br><br>
